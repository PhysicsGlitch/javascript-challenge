For the first UFO-level-1 table I kept the html and code simple. Creating the filter function and d3 event functions was very straight forward. In terms of populating the html code I tried a few
methods. However, to avoid plagiarism, I used this code from Stackoverflow. I was able to do most of it on my own, but then the simplicity of this method appealed to me.

Here is the reference for the table population function which I incorporated into my code: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/51275730/populate-html-table-with-json-data

It basically pulls the header elements and then uses a foreach function to then fill the data from the filtered data that is the first part of the code. The nice part of this is that this code
is also very easily replicable for the bonus level 2 assignment because I can keep this function by creating a final var filtered database but change how the first part of my function 
filters data in the more complex example.
